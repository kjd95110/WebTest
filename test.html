<p>Now that you have your component hierarchy, it’s time to implement your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It’s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We’ll see why.</p>
<p>To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using <em>props</em>. <em>props</em> are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you’re familiar with the concept of <em>state</em>, <strong>don’t use state at all</strong> to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.</p>
<p>You can build top-down or bottom-up. That is, you can either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (i.e. starting with <code class="gatsby-code-text">FilterableProductTable</code>) or with the ones lower in it (<code class="gatsby-code-text">ProductRow</code>). In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build.</p>
<p>At the end of this step, you’ll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. The components will only have <code class="gatsby-code-text">render()</code> methods since this is a static version of your app. The component at the top of the hierarchy (<code class="gatsby-code-text">FilterableProductTable</code>) will take your data model as a prop. If you make a change to your underlying data model and call <code class="gatsby-code-text">ReactDOM.render()</code> again, the UI will be updated. You can see how your UI is updated and where to make changes. React’s <strong>one-way data flow</strong> (also called <em>one-way binding</em>) keeps everything modular and fast.</p>

<p>There are two types of “model” data in React: props and state. It’s important to understand the distinction between the two; skim <a href="/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html">the official React docs</a> if you aren’t sure what the difference is. See also <a href="/docs/faq-state.html#what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-props">FAQ: What is the difference between state and props?</a></p>

<p>To make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with <strong>state</strong>.</p>
<p>To build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key here is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DRY: <em>Don’t Repeat Yourself</em></a>. Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you’re building a TODO list, keep an array of the TODO items around; don’t keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count, take the length of the TODO items array.</p>
<p>Think of all of the pieces of data in our example application. We have:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original list of products</li>
<li>The search text the user has entered</li>
<li>The value of the checkbox</li>
<li>The filtered list of products</li>
</ul>
